### **Project Idea: Personal Data Locker API**

#### **Description**:
Create an API called **Personal Data Locker**, a secure and decentralized platform for storing and retrieving personal files, notes, and encrypted information. The system ensures data integrity and high security without relying on third-party services like paid cloud storage or PostgreSQL.

---

#### **Core Features**:
1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.
   - Password hashing using bcrypt or another secure Go library.
   - User roles: Admin and Regular User.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Store data as encrypted files or JSON-like structures in **SQLite** or **BoltDB** (a lightweight key-value store).
   - Each user has a separate namespace for their stored data.

3. **File Upload and Download**:
   - Allow users to upload small files (like PDFs, images, or text files) with metadata.
   - Use a secure folder structure on the server to organize files by user.
   - Implement rate-limiting for file uploads.

4. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive files and notes using Go's `crypto` package before storage.
   - Ensure the encryption key is user-specific and never stored on the server.

5. **Searchable Metadata**:
   - Allow users to tag their data with searchable metadata (e.g., file type, creation date, tags).
   - Implement efficient search functionality.

6. **Activity Logs**:
   - Log user activities such as logins, uploads, and downloads into an activity log stored locally.

7. **API Documentation**:
   - Use Swagger or Postman to provide comprehensive API documentation.

8. **Local Deployment**:
   - Package the API for easy local deployment using Docker or a simple installation guide.

#### **Advanced Features (Optional)**:
1. **WebSocket Notifications**:
   - Real-time notifications for file upload/download activities.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Allow users to upload new versions of existing files, retaining previous versions for download.

3. **Offline Sync**:
   - Provide a CLI tool (also written in Go) to sync local files with the server.

4. **Role-based Data Sharing**:
   - Implement a feature where users can share specific files or data with other registered users.

5. **Backup & Restore**:
   - Allow users to export their data as encrypted zip files for backup.
   - Provide a restore endpoint for uploading backups.

---

#### **Skills Showcased**:
1. **API Design**: RESTful API principles with clean and efficient routes.
2. **Security**: JWT, encryption, rate-limiting, and secure file storage practices.
3. **Database Management**: Using SQLite or BoltDB creatively for structured data storage.
4. **Concurrency**: Handle simultaneous requests effectively using Go routines.
5. **Documentation**: API usability and onboarding for developers.
6. **Packaging and Deployment**: Dockerize and deploy locally or on a low-resource server.

---

#### **Next Steps**:
1. **Define the Schema**: Plan user models, file metadata structures, and database schema.
2. **Choose Libraries**:
   - SQLite: Use `gorm` or `sqlx` for database interaction.
   - JWT: `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4`.
   - File encryption: `crypto/aes`.
   - CLI Sync Tool: `cobra` for CLI tool creation.
3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Start with user authentication and database setup.
   - Build core CRUD functionality.
   - Implement encryption and file upload/download.
   - Add search and metadata tagging.
